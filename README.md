# AppleFucker v1.1
Have a local music library plagued by apple? This script will de-apple your library.

# Description
fixes verious mp4 encoding fuckery that i personally find annoying
1. changes [tracknumber]/[totaltracks] to [tracknumber]
2. removes discnumber tag for anything labeled 1/1
3. changes date format from YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm to YYYY

# Important Info
no there's no executable, run this through your favorite IDE  
this took a solid 30 seconds to run through my 3k songs so be patient with it.

this script requires all files to be encoded with ID3. 
i used the ffmpeg batch converter made by Abel to convert all my m4a's to mp3. 
it can be found here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffmpeg-batch/

# Future Versions
a v1.2 can be made upon request, assuming anyone other than me ever wants to run this code
it will have flac support, allow file path input through console, and might even be executable and return proper errors!

a 2.0 i imagine will convert m4a to whatever you want and then run the fixing code
